PLEASE READ:
Due to Angular transclusion, the route app component is added as a sibling of router-outlet,
but it also adds the app component itself as the root which bypasses our flex-layout implementation.
This is because the app component (e.g. pictly-home) is added programmatically, so we can't add fxLayout and
fxFlex rules to these app components.
